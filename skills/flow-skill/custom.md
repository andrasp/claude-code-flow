# Custom Workflow

**Context:** Work that doesn't fit neatly into predefined categories.

## Overview

This workflow provides the general research → plan → tasks → outcome structure without category-specific guidance. You define the focus and approach based on your specific needs.

## Phase 1: Understanding

Define what you're working on and gather the information you need.

Use `research.md` to document:
- What is the goal?
- What context is relevant?
- What constraints exist?
- What approaches are possible?

## Phase 2: Planning

Create a clear plan in `plan.md`:
- Goals and success criteria
- Approach and rationale
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Risks and mitigations

## Phase 3: Implementation

Break work into tasks in `tasks.md`:
- Concrete, actionable items
- Clear completion criteria
- Logical ordering

Execute systematically, updating progress as you go.

## Phase 4: Completion

Document results in `outcome.md`:
- What was accomplished
- Key decisions made
- Lessons learned
- Follow-up items if any

## Tips

- Define your own success criteria upfront
- Document decisions and rationale as you go
- Keep scope focused; split into multiple flows if needed
- Use additional documents as needed for your specific work
